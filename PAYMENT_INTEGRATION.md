## Testing Considerations
- Test with EdfaPay sandbox environment
- Verify payment status polling

## Configuration
All payment configuration is centralized in `/src/api/payment.ts`:
```typescript
const PAYMENT_CONFIG = {
  merchantKey: 'ccb9ad36-8e4a-492c-81e3-5569a2d66049',
  password: '1c5dbc06-fd45-4df1-87e9-dfb5c59fcf4e',
  apiUrl: 'https://api.edfapay.com/payment/initiate',
  statusUrl: 'https://api.edfapay.com/payment/status',
};
```

## Database Schema Updates Required
The visa_applications table should include these new fields:
- `payment_status` (varchar) - 'pending', 'paid', 'failed'
- `payment_id` (varchar) - Payment gateway ID
- `order_id` (varchar) - Unique order identifier
- `invoice_id` (varchar) - Reference to created invoice

## Next Steps
1. Test payment integration in development environment
2. Configure webhook endpoints for payment callbacks
3. Set up payment reconciliation processes
4. Implement payment receipt generation
5. Add payment history tracking for users
